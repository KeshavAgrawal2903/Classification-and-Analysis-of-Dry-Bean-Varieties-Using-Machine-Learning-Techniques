# Dry Bean Analysis Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and modeling data related to the **Dry Bean Dataset**.

## Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Visualization of key features and patterns.
- Machine learning model training and evaluation.
- Insights and conclusions drawn from the data.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- Any additional libraries used in the notebook.

## Dataset

The analysis uses the [Dry Bean Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information on various bean species and their features.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dry-bean-analysis.git
    cd dry-bean-analysis
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook DRYBEAN.ipynb
    ```

## Results
